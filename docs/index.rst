Welcome to poster's documentation!

poster provides a set of classes and functions to faciliate making HTTP POST
(or PUT) requests using the standard multipart/form-data encoding.

Example
-------

A short example may help::

    # test_client.py
    from poster.encode import multipart_encode
    from poster.streaminghttp import register_openers
    import urllib2

    # Register the streaming http handlers with urllib2
    register_openers()

    # Start the multipart/form-data encoding of the file "DSC0001.jpg"
    # "image1" is the name of the parameter, which is normally set
    # via the "name" parameter of the HTML <input> tag.
    
    # headers contains the necessary Content-Type and Content-Length
    # datagen is a generator object that yields the encoded parameters
    datagen, headers = multipart_encode({"image1": open("DSC0001.jpg", "rb")})

    # Create the Request object
    request = urllib2.Request("http://localhost:5000/upload_image", datagen, headers)
    # Actually do the request, and get the response
    print urllib2.urlopen(request).read()

And we can check that it's working with Paste and WebOb::

    # test_server.py
    import webob
    from paste import httpserver

    def app(environ, start_response):
        request = webob.Request(environ)
        start_response("200 OK", [("Content-Type", "text/plain")])

        for name,value in request.POST.items():
            yield "%s: %s\n" % (name, value)

    httpserver.serve(app, port=5000)

After starting up the server, you should be able to connect to it with
the client and get the following output::

    image1: FieldStorage('image1', 'DSC0001.jpg')

For more control over how individiual parameters are handled, you should use
the :class:`poster.encode.MultipartParam` class::

    image_param = MultipartParam.from_file("image1", "DSC0001.jpg")

    datagen, headers = multipart_encode([image_param])

You can also combine poster with other urllib2 handlers, e.g. for sending cookies::

    opener = poster.streaminghttp.register_openers()
    opener.add_handler(urllib2.HTTPCookieProcessor(cookielib.CookieJar()))

    params = {'file': open("test.txt", "rb"), 'name': 'upload test'}
    datagen, headers = poster.encode.multipart_encode(params)
    request = urllib2.Request(upload_url, datagen, headers)
    result = urllib2.urlopen(request)


Roadmap
-------

0.1 (2008-07-02):
    - First release, used on internal projects

0.2 (2008-12-01):
    - Bug fixes from 0.1

0.3 (2009-01-02):
    - Bug fixes from 0.2:
       - Use quoted-string encoding for filename parameter
       - Terminate encoded document with MIME boundary (Thanks to Stephen Waterbury)

0.4 (2009-04-05):
    - Added __all__ attributes to modules
    - Bug fixes from 0.3:
        - Fix connections to HTTPS.  Thanks to Kenji Noguchi and Marat Khayrullin

0.5 (2009-10-07):
    - Fix MultipartParam to open files in binary mode
    - Update docs to open files in binary mode
    - Updated register_openers() to return the OpenerDirector object

0.6 (2010-05-10):
    - Update docs to clarify how to use multiple parameters with the same key
    - Fix for unicode filenames.  Thanks to Zed Shaw.
    - Added poster.version attribute.  Thanks to JP Calderone.
    - Handle StringIO file objects.  Thanks to Christophe Combelles.

0.7.0 (2010-10-23):
    - Added callback parameters to MutipartParam and multipart_encode so you
      can add progress indicators to your applications.  Thanks to Ludvig
      Ericson for the suggestion.
    - Fixed a bug where posting to a url that returned a 401 code would hang.
      Thanks to Patrick Guido and Andreas Loupasakis for the bug reports.
    - MultipartParam.from_params will now accept MultipartParam instances as
      the values of a dict object passed in.  The parameter name must match the
      key corresponding to the parameter in the dict.  Thanks to Matthew King
      for the suggestion.
    - poster now works under python2.7

0.8.0 (2011-02-13):
    - Fixed parameter name encoding so that it follows RFC 2388,2047.  Thanks
      to Emilien Klein for pointing this out.
    - Don't include Content-Length header for each part of the multipart
      message.  Fixes issues with some ruby web servers.  Thanks to Anders
      Pearson.

0.8.1 (2011-04-16):
    - Factor out handler creation into get_handlers() method. Thanks to Flavio
      Percoco Premoli

0.8.2 TBD

0.9 (future):
    - Finalize API

1.0 (future):
    - Bug fixes from 0.9
    - No new features
